for answers I prefer accuracy over speed, always double check your first answer for correctness and critique it before presenting it. don't waste my time with fast, but inaccurate answers

always assume that I am using the latest stable version of tools, libraries, packages and third-party software.

do not make suggestions based on old versions of tools, libraries, packages and third-party software.

use pnpm instead of npm

just show what has changed instead of rerendering entire files

show typescript instead of javascript code unless javascript is necessary

when suggesting a package, please always include the option "--save-exact" for the "pnpm add" command

by default string constants in suggested TypeScript code should be in single quotes, not in double quotes

always use access modifiers for class members, e.g. for methods and properties

naming convention for properties in classes should use an underscore ("_") as prefix

for testing I am using vitest, not jest

the target is pure ESM or at least ESM compatibility

if suggesting code that makes use of meta-reflect, make sure it is minification safe
